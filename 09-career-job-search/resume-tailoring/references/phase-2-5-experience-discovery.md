### Phase 2.5: Experience Discovery (OPTIONAL)

**Goal:** Surface undocumented experiences through conversational discovery

**When to trigger:**
```
After template approval, if gaps identified:

"I've identified {N} gaps or areas where we have weak matches:
- {Gap 1}: {Current confidence}
- {Gap 2}: {Current confidence}
...

Would you like to do a structured brainstorming session to surface
any experiences you haven't documented yet?

This typically takes 10-15 minutes and often uncovers valuable content."

User can accept or skip.
```

**Branching Interview Process:**

**Approach:** Conversational with follow-up questions based on answers

**For each gap, conduct branching dialogue (see branching-questions.md):**

1. **Start with open probe:**
   - Technical gap: "Have you worked with {skill}?"
   - Soft skill gap: "Tell me about times you've {demonstrated_skill}"
   - Recent work: "What have you worked on recently?"

2. **Branch based on answer:**
   - YES/Strong → Deep dive (scale, challenges, metrics)
   - INDIRECT → Explore role and transferability
   - ADJACENT → Explore related experience
   - PERSONAL → Assess recency and substance
   - NO → Try broader category or move on

3. **Follow-up systematically:**
   - Ask "what," "how," "why" to get details
   - Quantify: "Any metrics?"
   - Contextualize: "Was this production?"
   - Validate: "Does this address the gap?"

4. **Capture immediately:**
   - Document experience as shared
   - Ask clarifying questions (dates, scope, impact)
   - Help articulate as resume bullet
   - Tag which gap(s) it addresses

**Capture Structure:**
```markdown
## Newly Discovered Experiences

### Experience 1: {Brief description}
- Context: {Where/when}
- Scope: {Scale, duration, impact}
- Addresses: {Which gaps}
- Bullet draft: "{Achievement-focused bullet}"
- Confidence: {How well fills gap - percentage}

### Experience 2: ...
```

**Integration Options:**

After discovery session:
```
"Great! I captured {N} new experiences. For each one:

1. ADD TO CURRENT RESUME - Integrate now
2. ADD TO LIBRARY ONLY - Save for future, not needed here
3. REFINE FURTHER - Think more about articulation
4. DISCARD - Not relevant enough

Let me know for each experience."
```

**Important Notes:**
- Keep truthfulness bar high - help articulate, NEVER fabricate
- Focus on gaps and weak matches, not strong areas
- Time-box if needed (10-15 minutes typical)
- User can skip entirely if confident in library
- Recognize when to move on - don't exhaust user

**Output:** New experiences integrated into library, ready for matching
